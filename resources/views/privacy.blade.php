Urpixpays and its authorized agents automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on their server logs from your browser including your IP address, Urpixpays cookie information, and the page you requested. Urpixpays uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyse trends and administer the website. This does not involve collecting any of your personal information.
                        In addition to the "traffic data", Urpixpays and its authorized agents may collect information about the device you're using to access Urpixpays, its operating system, unique device identifier, device settings such as language and crash data. Which data is specifically collected depends on the type of device and/or system running on that device. This data is again used to help us diagnose problems with the site and/or mobile apps and analyse usage trends. This does not involve collecting any of your personal information.
                        Urpixpays may collect and use information regarding the geographic location of your devices. If the location data contains your personal information, then Urpixpays will treat this location data in accordance with this Policy. Urpixpays may collect and, on any page, display the total counts that page has been viewed. This includes User Profile pages.
                        Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While Urpixpays will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.
