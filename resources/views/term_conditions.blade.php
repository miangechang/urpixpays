Urpixpays will also charge the customer a postage and handling fee. The base price is the fee Urpixpays charges to produce and print the product. The percentage mark-up you select for each of your products is used to calculate the dollar value of your margin for each sale and will result in a final price to be given to the customers. You may change your desired percentage mark-up at any time for each photograph by changing your selection on the My Store section in the Urpixpays Website. We may change the base production price at any time without specific notice to you and this will affect the dollar value of your chosen margin, which is calculated as a percentage of the base price.<br>
                  Urpixpays will notify you via the Urpixpays website and email when one of your products is sold.  <br>

Any controversies or disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association or of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution to be held in the jurisdictions of United States. The parties shall select a mutually acceptable arbitrator knowledgeable about issues relating to the subject matter of these Terms. The arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in English and all documentation shall be presented and filed in English. All documents, materials and information in the possession of each party that are in any way relevant to the dispute shall be made available to the other party for review and copying no later than 30 days after the notice of arbitration is served. The arbitrator shall not have the authority to modify any provision of these Terms or to award punitive damages. The arbitrator shall have the power to issue mandatory orders and restraint orders in connection with the arbitration. The decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties, and judgment may be entered in conformity with the decision in any court having jurisdiction. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable legal costs relating to that aspect of its claim or defence on which it prevails, and any opposing costs awards shall be offset. The agreement to arbitration shall be specifically enforceable under the prevailing arbitration law. During the continuance of any arbitration proceeding, the parties shall continue to perform their respective obligations under these Terms. The parties agree that, notwithstanding any otherwise applicable statute(s) of limitation, any arbitration proceeding shall be commenced within two years of the acts, events, or occurrences giving rise to the claim.
